# Structured Query Language data projects

SQL queries to showcase proficiency with the language. 
And also to save some code snippets.

### Projects tackled

1. [COVID-19 data exploration](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/sql_projects/tree/main/covid_data)
  * Data taken from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
  in December 3rd 2021. Contains populations per country, vaccinations, death
  statistics, and more.
  * Query mainly showcases SELECT, WHERE statements based on LIKE/NOT LIKE, JOIN,
  GROUP BY, PARTITION BY, creation of CTEs/#temp tables/VIEWs, CAST function, and column 
  calculations with SUM and some math operators.
2. [Nashville Housing Market Data](https://github.com/GabrielReisR/sql_projects/tree/main/nashville_housing)
  * Data extracted from 
  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data) on December
  6th 2021. Contains data for the selling of houses in Nashville, like property
  address, sell price, sell date, and more.
  * Query contains important data cleaning tools, such as ADD/SET/UPDATE functions, standardization of DATE with CONVERT(), population of blank cells with using self JOIN, parsing of nvarchars using SUBSTRING() and PARSENAME(), CASE WHEN, removing duplicates with CTEs, and DELETE columns.
  
*All projects were done using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.*
